## Project Write Up

1. Technologies used: React, Material UI, Bootstrap, animate.css.

I chose to use react because it's a very flexible library that works well with many different CSS tools, allows server rendering, and keeps code clean by allowing you to use reusible components. React is popular with larger apps and CRUD applications but I truly enjoy working with it which is another reason I chose it for this project.
Material UI is an older library but I love the icons that come with it and how easy it is too use.
Bootstrap is my favorite library to use with carousels. The code is right out of the box and it's easy to customize.

2. The challenge I ran into while developing this project is importing the svg logos. I don't often use svg's with react and in order to import them, I had to put them each in their own component which made the code less clean than I wanted.

3. I love transforming mock ups into usable applications, it's my favorite part of development. This project was a lot of fun!
